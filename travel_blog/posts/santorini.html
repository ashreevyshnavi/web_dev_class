          <p>With its white-washed houses, blue-domed churches, and spectacular sunsets, Santorini is a Mediterranean paradise. A weekend here feels like stepping into a postcard.</p>

          <h2>Day 1: Exploring Oia</h2>
          <p>Our journey began in the iconic village of Oia, famous for its stunning caldera views. We wandered through its charming alleys, stopping for fresh Greek yogurt topped with honey and nuts.</p>
          
          <p>The afternoon was spent sailing along the Aegean Sea, where we swam in volcanic hot springs and admired the island’s rugged cliffs. As the sun set, we found a perfect spot at a clifftop taverna to witness Santorini’s legendary golden hour.</p>

          <h2>Day 2: Beachside Bliss</h2>
          <p>The second day took us to the island’s unique beaches. We started with Red Beach, known for its dramatic red cliffs, before heading to Perissa Beach for a relaxing swim.</p>
          
          <p>In the afternoon, we explored the ancient ruins of Akrotiri, a Minoan Bronze Age settlement preserved under volcanic ash. The day ended with a wine-tasting tour, where we sampled Vinsanto, a sweet wine unique to Santorini.</p>

          <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
