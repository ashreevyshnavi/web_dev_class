          <p>New York, the city that never sleeps, is a whirlwind of energy, culture, and iconic landmarks. Even in just a weekend, you can experience the magic of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and beyond.</p>

          <h2>Day 1: Manhattan Marvels</h2>
          <p>We started our adventure in Times Square, the heartbeat of NYC, buzzing with lights and excitement. From there, we made our way to Central Park for a peaceful morning walk among skyscrapers and nature.</p>
          
          <p>Afterward, we visited the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), home to Van Gogh’s *Starry Night* and other masterpieces. A quick stop at a classic New York deli, Katz’s Delicatessen, for a pastrami sandwich kept us fueled for the afternoon. We ended our day at the Empire State Building, where the nighttime skyline took our breath away.</p>

          <h2>Day 2: Exploring Brooklyn</h2>
          <p>The second day was all about Brooklyn. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge early in the morning, taking in stunning city views. Then, we explored DUMBO, known for its charming cobblestone streets, indie boutiques, and great coffee spots.</p>
          
          <p>In the afternoon, we relaxed at Williamsburg’s waterfront, soaking in views of Manhattan while enjoying artisanal food from Smorgasburg. The day ended with a rooftop cocktail at Westlight, watching the city lights shimmer.</p>

          <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
          <p>We chose a chic boutique hotel in Midtown Manhattan, placing us near key attractions and subway access.</p>

          <h2>Dining Highlights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: Buvette - Cozy French-inspired café</li>
            <li>Lunch: Joe’s Pizza - Classic New York slice</li>
            <li>Dinner: Peter Luger Steak House - Legendary steakhouse in Brooklyn</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Use the subway for the fastest and cheapest transport</li>
