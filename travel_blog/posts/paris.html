          <p>Paris, the City of Light, has always held a special place in the hearts of travelers. During our recent weekend adventure, we discovered that even in just 48 hours, this magical city can capture your soul and leave you wanting more.</p>

          <h2>Day 1: Classic Parisian Charm</h2>
          <p>Our journey began at the iconic Eiffel Tower, arriving just as the morning sun cast its golden light across the iron lattice. Pro tip: book your tickets online in advance to avoid the notorious queues. The view from the top was nothing short of spectacular, offering a panoramic vista of the city's distinctive Haussmanian architecture.</p>
          
          <p>After descending, we strolled through the charming streets of the 7th arrondissement, eventually making our way to Rue Cler, a vibrant market street where we sampled fresh croissants and coffee at a local café. The afternoon was spent at the Musée d'Orsay, housed in a beautiful former railway station, where we lost ourselves among impressionist masterpieces.</p>

          <h2>Day 2: Hidden Gems</h2>
          <p>Our second day began in the historic Le Marais district, where medieval architecture meets trendy boutiques. We discovered hidden courtyards and enjoyed breakfast at a quaint boulangerie, savoring pain au chocolat that melted in our mouths.</p>
          
          <p>The afternoon led us to the less-touristy Canal Saint-Martin neighborhood, where we joined locals for a picnic along the waterway. The area's street art and independent shops offered a glimpse into contemporary Parisian life, far from the tourist crowds.</p>

          <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
          <p>We chose a boutique hotel in the 6th arrondissement, placing us within walking distance of both the Latin Quarter and Saint-Germain-des-Prés. This location proved perfect for evening strolls and easy access to the Metro.</p>

          <h2>Dining Highlights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: Le Petit Grain - Best croissants in the city</li>
            <li>Lunch: Chez L'Ami Louis - Classic French bistro</li>
            <li>Dinner: Le Baratin - Modern French cuisine with a twist</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Purchase a 48-hour Metro pass for unlimited travel</li>
            <li>Most museums are free on the first Sunday of each month</li>
            <li>Make dinner reservations at least a week in advance</li>
            <li>Learn a few basic French phrases - it goes a long way!</li>
          </ul>
